# Airflow-Spark Job Orchestration  

This project demonstrates how to orchestrate Apache Spark jobs using Apache Airflow's `SparkSubmitOperator`. By integrating Airflow's powerful workflow automation capabilities with Spark's distributed data processing, this setup provides an efficient and scalable solution for managing data pipelines.  

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used  
- **Apache Airflow**: For workflow scheduling and orchestration.  
- **Apache Spark**: For distributed processing of large-scale data.  
- **Python**: To define workflows and tasks.  
- **Docker**: For containerization, ensuring portability and ease of deployment.  

## üìö Project Overview  
The project focuses on running Spark jobs via Airflow. Spark jobs are defined externally and executed through the `SparkSubmitOperator` within Airflow DAGs. This setup allows users to:  
- Manage complex workflows with Airflow's UI and scheduling tools.  
- Leverage Spark for distributed data processing.  
- Monitor execution and logs directly from the Airflow UI.  

## üöÄ Features  
- **Job Scheduling and Monitoring**:  
  - Use Airflow's UI to schedule, trigger, and monitor Spark jobs.  
- **Scalable Data Processing**:  
  - Execute Spark jobs in a distributed manner for efficient data handling.  
- **Containerized Setup**:  
  - Use Docker to ensure consistent deployments across environments.  

## üîß How to Use  
1. **Clone the Repository**:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/airflow-spark-job-orchestration.git  
   cd airflow-spark-job-orchestration  
2. Set Up Docker:
Start the Airflow and Spark services using Docker Compose:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up  
3. Access the Airflow Web UI:
Navigate to http://localhost:8080 and log in using the default credentials.
4. Configure DAGs:
Add your Spark job scripts to the designated directory and configure the Airflow DAGs to reference them.
5. Run Spark Jobs:
Trigger the DAGs from the Airflow UI to execute your Spark jobs.
